    <h1>Nutscape and Exploder Challenge</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>This assignment is an homage to the earliest days of the commercial web. 
      Back in the mid-1990s when the browser wars were heating up, developers had their own
      pet names for Netscape Navigator ("Nutscape") and Internet Explorer ("Internet Exploder") 
      that reflected just how frustrated they were with the state of the art. 
      These best available browsers were horribly unstable, crashing multiple times per day (or hour). To
      make matters worse, both Netscape and Microsoft tried to stay ahead of the standards by adding
      proprietary language features and tags, making it impossible sometimes for developers to get their pages working
      in both browsers at the same time.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>In this folder are two html files, netscape.html and microsoft.html, each a lightly edited version of the homepage of each company in the mid-1990s. 
      Neither is anywhere near valid in any recent version of HTML. Your task is to revise each page so that it follows contemporary standards and norms in
      in HTML5 and CSS3. When complete, the pages should replicate the content and look of the pages as closely as possible using valid HTML5 and CSS3.</p>
    <p>There are a few rules to follow when making your revisions:
      <ol>
        <li>Please do not edit the original files. Instead, edit the copies with "-html5" in the filename.</li>
        <li>If you delete an obsolete or deprecated element then replicate the intended effect of the original markup using HTML5/CSS3 equivalents.</li>
        <li>Do not delete any text content. </li>
        <li>Logos and other meaningful images should be retained. (They don't belong to us!) Spacer gifs and other non-meaningful images should be deleted.</li>
        <li>Do not reorder any tags or content unless absolutely required to comply with HTML5 standards.</li>
        <li>Table layouts and other elements that are being used in a non-semantic fashion are to be replaced with equivalents that meet HTML5 norms.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Rather than attempt to complete this challenge in one sitting, we will instead approach it in small installments that reflect where we are in the textbook.</p>

  <h1>This is an app, not a folder!</h1>
  <p>Since Codenvy treats this project folder like a web app, it always opens up this index.html file. 
  <strong>To open a file in this project you'll need to add a relative path to it to the end of this page's URL
  in your browser.</strong> (Relative URLs are covered in chapter 6 of the book.) 
  </p>
  <h2>So how do get the relative URL?</h2>
  <p> The relative path is really easy to figure out:
  <ol>
    <li>Type out the name of the file you want.</li>
    <li>Follow the folde rhierarchy one level to the folder that contains your file. 
      <em>In front of the filename</em>, insert the folder name and then a slash.</li>
    <li>Repeat step 2 for each folder up the hierarchy, each time inserting the folder name 
    and a slash to the front of our relative URL.</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <p>For example, here's a step-by-step to create the path to the couscous.html file inside the jenskitchen folder:
  <ol>
    <li>path = coucous.html</li>
    <li>path = pasta/coucous.html</li>
    <li>path = recipes/pasta/couscous.html</li>
    <li>path = jenskitchen/recipes/pasta/couscous.html</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <p>Once you get used to creating relative URLs, you'll start creating them 
  from the top of the hierarchy. It's slightly quicker that way.</p>
  <h2>What do I do once I've got the relative URL</h2>
  <p>Paste your path to the end of the end of the URL in your browser. Then you may want to add it to the links below.</p>
  
 <h2>A few convenient links (which might not work until you're done)</h2>
 <ul>
 <li><a href="bistro/index.html">bistro/index.html</a></li>
 <li><a href="bistro/recipe.html">bistro/recipe.html</a></li>
 <li><a href="bistro/post.html">bistro/post.html</a></li>
